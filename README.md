# Bidi - Game development framework

Bidi is a tiny framework for developing small video games for recreational
purpose. It takes heavy inspiration from LÃ–VE and Pico8.

You develop your games in Lua and you are only allowed to have one Lua file
where all your code lives. You can then load external assets like images and
sounds.
